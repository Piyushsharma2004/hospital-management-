African-Americans over age 40 everyone over age 60, especially Hispanics/Latinos people with a family history of glaucoma.  In addition to age, eye pressure is a risk factor. Whether you develop glaucoma depends on the level of pressure your optic nerve can tolerate without being damaged. This level is different for each person. Thats why a comprehensive dilated eye exam is very important. It can help your eye care professional determine what level of eye pressure is normal for you. Another risk factor for optic nerve damage relates to blood pressure. Thus, it is important to also make sure that your blood pressure is at a proper level for your body by working with your medical doctor.
